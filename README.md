# Create-a-web-API-with-ASP.NET-Core-controllers-
This is the resolution of a training proposed by Microsft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/1-introduction)

Example scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful service for pizza inventory management as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizzaâ€”a standardized usage of HTTP verbs better known as create, read, update, delete (CRUD).

What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll create a new web API application by using ASP.NET Core, and learn how to run and test it from the command line. Then, you'll add a data store and a new API controller. Finally, you'll implement and test the API methods to create, read, update, and delete pizzas from the data store.

What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to create new web API applications by using ASP.NET Core. You'll also know how to create API controllers that implement basic CRUD logic.
