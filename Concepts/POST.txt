To enable users to add a new item to the endpoint, you must implement the POST action by using the [HttpPost] attribute.
When you pass the item into the method as a parameter, ASP.NET Core will automatically convert any application/JSON that's sent
to the endpoint into a populated .NET object.

[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Pizza pizza)
{            
    // This code will save the pizza and return a result
}

The [HttpPost] attribute will map HTTP POST requests sent to http://localhost:5000/pizza by using the Create() method.
Instead of returning a list of pizzas, as we saw with the Get() method, this method returns an IActionResult response.

IActionResult lets the client know if the request succeeded and provides the ID of the newly created pizza. 
IActionResult does this by using standard HTTP status codes, so it can easily integrate with clients regardless of the language or platform they're running on.

Post in HTTP repl

Example:
post -c "{"name":"Hawaii", "isGlutenFree":false}"
