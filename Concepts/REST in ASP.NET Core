If you interact with the page by doing something like submitting a sign-in form or selecting a buy button, 
the browser sends the information back to the web server.

Web servers communicacte with other clients (browsers,mobile devices,other web servers, etc.)
by using webservices.

API clients communicate with the server over HTTP, and the two exchange information by using a data format such as JSON or XML

APIs are often used in single-page applications (SPAs) that perform most of the user interface logic in a web browser.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for building web services.
REST requests are made over HTTP.
They use the same HTTP verbs that web browsers use to retrieve webpages and to send data to servers. 

GET: Retrieve data from the web service.

POST: Create a new item of data on the web service.

PUT: Update an item of data on the web service.

PATCH: Update an item of data on the web service by describing a set of instructions about how the item should be modified. 
The sample application in this module doesn't use this verb.

DELETE: Delete an item of data on the web service.

RESTful APIs - are defined by..

1) Base URL
2) HTTP methods
3) Data - JSON/XML

We use routing to map URIs to logical divisions in our code, so that requests to https://localhost:5000/pizza are routed to PizzaController. 
Requests to https://localhost:5000/order are routed to OrderController.
